# Abstract

This study investigates the predictive capacity of machine learning algorithms for cardiovascular disease (CVD) based on many diagnostic variables. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a collection of diseases impacting the cardiovascular system that can be caused by an individual’s genetic arrangement,
lifestyle, and circumstances. Typical warning symptoms include
chest pain, increased blood pressure, increased cholesterol, fasting
blood sugar, resting ECG abnormalities, maximal heart rate
during exercise, and angina brought on by activity. These characteristics are taken into account in prediction models together
with other variables like age, gender, and family history to assess
an individual’s risk of CVD. This could make it possible for
medical professionals to assess the risk and provide appropriate
actions to reduce the chance of CVD. Each algorithm must
undergo training and testing across multiple patient datasets
to produce prediction models. Techniques for assessing features
are employed to determine the most important characteristics
for CVD prediction. Metrics like accuracy, precision, recall,
and F1 score are used to show how well the models can
perform. This shows how the algorithms function differently
and exhibit traits specific to their respective prediction domains.
While SVM is better at handling complex information and has
significant discriminatory power, KNN is better at identifying
local patterns. Both Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes offer
detailed predictions and insights into the importance of particular
attributes. The study highlights how crucial it is to analyze
a model’s performance using various metrics, such as recall,
accuracy, and F1 score, to obtain a clear and detailed view
of predictive capability.Finally, these metrics are then used to
predict positive CVD cases
